cumulative deaths in each county = New York State Statewide COVID-19 Fatalities by County - Place of Fatality
cumulative positives in each county = New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing - Cumulative Number of Positives

ratio of deaths in each county / positive tests = COVID lethality in that county

goal is to compare that value against the total number of years that counties get funding from HNP
as well as against ambient air quality

TODO:
Need to clean dataset to make St. Lawrence compatible with map and lethality metric
Need to establish air quality by country and compare to lethality data
