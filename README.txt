cumulative deaths in each county = New York State Statewide COVID-19 Fatalities by County - Place of Fatality
cumulative positives in each county = New York State Statewide COVID-19 Testing - Cumulative Number of Positives

ratio of deaths in each county / positive tests = COVID lethality in that county

goal is to compare that value against the total number of years that counties get funding from HNP
as well as against ambient air quality
